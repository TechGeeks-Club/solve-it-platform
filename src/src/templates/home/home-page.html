    <h2>What's Solve It?</h2>
    <p>
      The C Code Challenge is a programming competition that focuses on
      the C language. It's a great opportunity to showcase your coding
      skills, learn new programming techniques, and connect with other
      developers. We'll provide a set of problems for you to solve, and
      you'll have a limited time to complete as many as you can. The top
      participants will receive prizes and recognition for their
      achievements. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting
      started, the C Code Challenge is a fun and rewarding way to test
      your skills and build your portfolio.
