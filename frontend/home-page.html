            The C Code Challenge is a programming competition that focuses on
            the C language. It's a great opportunity to showcase your coding
            skills, learn new programming techniques, and connect with other
            developers. We'll provide a set of problems for you to solve, and
            you'll have a limited time to complete as many as you can. The top
            participants will receive prizes and recognition for their
            achievements. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting
            started, the C Code Challenge is a fun and rewarding way to test
            your skills and build your portfolio.
